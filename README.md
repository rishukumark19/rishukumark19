# 🚀 Rishu Kumar — Developer Portfolio

A fast, interactive, and fully responsive personal portfolio showcasing my journey into **Python Backend Development** (FastAPI, Django) and building **modern, lightweight UIs** with **HTMX** and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project embodies the **"less JavaScript, more HTML"** philosophy.

| **Glass Morphism** | Subtle, frosted card effects that change seamlessly between light and dark modes. |
| **Interactivity** | **HTMX** powers the expandable project cards, providing a modern, rich user experience without heavy JS dependencies. |
| **Tilt Effect** | Micro-interactions on key cards (hover over the main card!) to add a polished feel. |
| **Breathing Glow** | The **dark mode** background features a subtle, slow animation for a dynamic, deep-space feel. |
